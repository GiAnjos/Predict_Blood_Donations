# Predict_Blood_Donations
This is a guided project of DataCamp to predict blood donations in a campus on Taiwan. 


This dataset is from a mobile blood donation vehicle in Taiwan. The Blood Transfusion Service Center drives to different universities and collects blood as part of a blood drive. We want to predict whether or not a donor will give blood the next time the vehicle comes to campus.
